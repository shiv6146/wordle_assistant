# Wordle Assistant

An assistant to solve Wordle puzzles by suggesting the best next guess based on your previous guesses and feedback. 
This assistant is designed for targets that are **not historical Wordle answers** (i.e., it has a static vocabulary of 12k allowed guesses excluding the historical answers updated daily).

## Entropy-Based Suggestions

Uses information theory to recommend the best next guess. More about [entropy](entropy.md)
